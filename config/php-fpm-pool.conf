; Use the default www-data user and group.
user = www-data
group = www-data

; Listen on a TCP socket (standard for separate Nginx/FPM containers).
listen = 9000
; Allow connections from any IPv4/IPv6 address (within the Docker network).
listen.allowed_clients = 0.0.0.0/0

; --- Process Manager Settings (Optimized for Low Memory) ---

; Use 'ondemand' process manager: processes are forked only when needed.
; Good for low-traffic sites or memory-constrained environments.
pm = ondemand

; Maximum number of child processes to be created. Acts as a safety limit.
; Start low (adjust based on monitoring RAM usage). 10-15 is a reasonable start for 1-2GB.
pm.max_children = 15

; How long a child process will wait for a connection before terminating itself.
; Shorter timeout saves memory faster when idle.
pm.process_idle_timeout = 10s

; The number of requests each child process should execute before respawning.
; Helps prevent memory leaks in PHP or libraries. 500 is a common value.
pm.max_requests = 500

; Add status path for health checks
pm.status_path = /status

; --- Other Settings ---

; Redirect worker stdout and stderr to the main FPM log files.
catch_workers_output = yes

; Set access log format (optional).
;access.format = "[%t] %m %{REQUEST_URI}e %s %f cpu:%C%% mem:%Mmb pid:%p"

; Clear environment variables for security (PHP scripts won't inherit system env).
clear_env = no ; Keep 'no' as WordPress relies on env vars passed by Docker Compose.

; Pass environment variables like PATH.
env[PATH] = /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
; Pass other env vars if needed by PHP scripts (e.g., TEMP, TMPDIR).
; env[TMP] = /tmp
; env[TMPDIR] = /tmp
; env[TEMP] = /tmp
